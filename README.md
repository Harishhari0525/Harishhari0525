## 🚀 About Me

Hey! I'm Harish, a professional Application Support Engineer by day, Vibe Coder by night, and a full-time <strike>meme</strike> tech enthusiast 24/7.

When I'm not fighting production fires or explaining to users that "turning it off and on again" is a legitimate troubleshooting step, I'm usually:

- Refactoring my own life in Shell scripts
- Hunting bugs like Indiana Jones (but with more coffee and less treasure)
- Building applications from the wildest ideas (yes, even that one)

---

## 🛠️ My Toolbox

Here's what I wield in my daily battles against the forces of downtime:

- **SQL**: I speak fluent SELECT, and occasionally argue with JOINs
- **UNIX & Shell Scripting**: Because why click when you can type?
- **Production Support**: If it breaks at 2AM, you know who gets the call
- **Splunk**: My crystal ball for logs – I can find your missing semicolon
- **Python**: For when things need to get done (and for automating the boring stuff)
- **Prompt Engineering & Gen AI**: Teaching AIs to be less robotic, one prompt at a time

---

## 🌟 Projects That (Mostly) Work

### 🏆 UPI Tracker
The crown jewel in my project arsenal!  
A production-ready app so robust, even my mother uses it (and she still calls CDs “shiny pancakes”).

## 🏷️ Tagline

> Tech Enthusiast – If it's got code, I want to break it (and then fix it better).

## 😎 Fun Facts & Hobbies

- **Vibe Coding**: Yes, it’s a real thing. Spotify + caffeine + late night = innovation (or existential dread)
- **Building Apps from Ideas**: I believe every weird idea deserves an app. No exceptions.
- **Sarcasm**: My second language. If you can’t handle my code jokes, you probably shouldn’t see my commit messages.
